                                           Introduction to the Most Profitable Stories in Hollywood
The Hollywood movie industry produces a wide array of films every year, spanning various genres, studios, and audience types. However, not all films achieve the same level of profitability. Some firms outperform others in terms of box office returns and audience reception, making them more profitable investments. This project aims to analyze key factors that contribute to the profitability of Hollywood films and to identify patterns that correlate with higher profits.

                                            Objective
                                            
The main objective of this project is to:
* Understand the factors that influence the profitability of Hollywood films.
* Analyze relationships between audience scores, Rotten Tomatoes scores, and film profitability.
* Visualize trends to discover how genres, studios, and other factors impact the success of films.
* Provide actionable insights to filmmakers and investors on key factors that could lead to a more successful box office performance.

                                               Tasks
  
The project follows a systematic approach consisting of the following tasks:

Data Collection & Preparation:
* Gather data on various Hollywood films, including their genre, release year, lead studio, profitability, audience score, Rotten Tomatoes score, and worldwide gross.
* Ensure that the data is cleaned and ready for analysis (data type change,replaced values,reordered columns, deal with missing values, etc).

Data Analysis:
* Analyze the data to understand the distribution and relationships between different factors (e.g., genre, year, audience score, profitability).
* Calculate profitability as the ratio of gross earnings to production costs or as given by a profitability metric.

Visualization:
Create chart and graphs power BI tools to visualize key insight:
* Bar charts to compare the profitability by lead studio and genre.
* Scatter plots to observe the relationship between audience scores, Rotten Tomatoes scores  by films.
* Donut charts for count of films and studio distribution.
* Stacked column chart to see profitability by genre.
* Ribbon chart for world wide gross by lead studio.
* Waterfall chart for which year count of film genre are more than.

                                         Dashboard & Report Creation

The report is designed to provide an interactive, user-friendly experience that allows users to access critical details about each film with a single click. It combines several key metrics, including Audience Score, Rotten Tomatoes Score, Film Genre, Lead Studio, and more, to offer a holistic view of what makes a Hollywood most profitable film

Click on Film: Clicking on the title of any specific film in the report dashboard will reveal all the related details in one view.
* Audience Score: Displays the film’s audience rating percentage.
* Rotten Tomatoes Score: Shows the critical reception score.
* Total Films: If you are analyzing multiple films, this feature will list the total number of films you are exploring.

Click on Genre: When you click on a genre (e.g., Comedy, Drama, Action), it filters the dashboard to show only the movies of that specific genre, allowing you to:
* View the profitability trends within that genre.
* Compare audience and critical reception across films of the same genre.
               
Click on Lead Studio: Clicking on the Lead Studio name (e.g., Yash Raj Films, Dharma Productions) will display:
* The total number of films produced by that studio.
* The average profitability and gross earnings of the studio’s films.
* A comparison of audience reception and Rotten Tomatoes score across different films from that studio.

                                        Outcomes
                                        
The outcomes from this analysis will help answer key questions such as:
* Which genres are most profitable?
* What is the relationship between audience score and Rotten tomatoes?
* Does the lead studio impact a film’s profitability?
* How do critical reviews (Rotten Tomatoes) correlate with box office success?
* Are films with higher audience scores generally more profitable?
* What years saw the highest profitability trends for certain genres?
* Profitability trends: Films from a certain genre (e.g., animation or superhero films) may show consistently high profitability.
* Critical vs. audience reception: Films with lower critical reception (Rotten Tomatoes) may still have high audience scores and profitability, indicating a disconnect between critics and general viewers.

                                        Challenges
  
During the course of the analysis, several challenges were encountered:
* Data Quality: Some films may not have complete data for every metric (e.g., profitability or Rotten Tomatoes score), which required careful handling of missing data.
* Subjectivity of Scores: Audience scores and Rotten Tomatoes scores are subjective and vary based on various factors, which could introduce bias into the analysis.
* Data Limitations: The analysis is constrained by the available data, such as missing films or incomplete information on production costs for profitability calculation.
* Correlation vs. Causation: It's important to note that just because two factors are correlated (e.g., higher audience score and higher profitability), it doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other.

                                         Final Report

* Data Visualizations: Bar charts, scatter plots, Donut charts, stacked column charts,waterfall charts and line charts illustrating key insights from the analysis.
* Key Findings: The most profitable genres.
  * Studios that consistently produce high-grossing films.
  * The relationship between critical scores and profitability.
  * Trends in profitability across different years.
